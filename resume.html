				 Co-architected a new declarative UI framework that defined the application layer with its behaviors and data bindings (observers),
				 and created an innovative widget framework that empowered designers to develop rich graphical experiences,
				 creative layouts and transitions, and deploy to the targeted hardware in a matter of seconds.
				 This UI framework significantly improved the user experience, quality and time-to-market while simplifying customizations.
				 It worked from low-end to high-end devices thanks to the careful usage of memory and performance optimizations
				 It shipped on a number of Motorola devices including the ROKR E8 and the MOTO U9.

				 Architected and managed the Mobile Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) project from conception to deployment on Motorola’s Linux-Java product line.
				 Just like HTML browsers, SVG browsers support DOM APIs (core, event model), JavaScript bindings, i18n, text wrapping, text edition, images, xml parsing,
				 CSS, JavaScript, link walking/traversing, etc. In addition, they also support SMIL animations, text scaling and rotation, graphical shapes,
				 matrix transformations, embedded fonts, transparency, gradients, video, audio, etc.

				<li>Managed and co-implemented Motorola’s SVG player (including an implementation of JSR135 (SVG), JSR226 and Javascript bindings). Implementation highly optimized the memory usage, footprint and performance (benchmarked better than other 3rd party SVG engines).</li>
				<li>Led its integration into different applications (Start-up screen, browser, media player, Java bindings, home screen).</li>
				<li>Leveraged the SVG engine infrastructure to develop the MMS player (transitions, rendering, DOM, HTML rendering, parsing).</li>
				<li>Maintained highest standards of quality by automating regression tests, memory corruption tests, leak detection, unit test execution,
				    code size monitoring, image correlation tests against a baseline (>1000 svg files), document generation and the display of these results on a web site.
				    One of the tests checked the engine stability by failing one-by-one every memory allocation.</li>
				<li>Mentored dev, qa and release engineers on debugging skills, good practices and processes.</li>
				<li>Engine capabilities and its potential was demonstrated to the CTO: Padmasree Warrior.</li>
